# [@] - expand the elements of the array toBackup as separate arguments
# Chat GPT:
# By using "${toBackup[@]}", you can ensure that each element of the array is correctly passed to the tar command, 
# allowing you to include multiple files and directories in the archive without explicitly specifying each one individually.
